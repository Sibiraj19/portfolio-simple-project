**Simple Portfolio Website**

This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. The site consists of two pages: a homepage and a contact page. Its purpose is to showcase personal projects and provide contact information. The design prioritizes simplicity and clarity to ensure ease of navigation and accessibility. Feel free to explore the pages to learn more about my work and get in touch!
